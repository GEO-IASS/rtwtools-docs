Installation
============

System Requirements
-------------------
A computer running any version of ENVI.

**Beware:** RTWTools has only been tested on ENVI 4.6.1 and ENVI 4.7. It may or may not work on other versions.


Installation
------------
1. Copy the RTWTools.sav file provided in this zip file to the ENVI `save_add` directory. This is normally located at ``C:\Program Files\ITT\IDL708\products\envi46\save_add\``

2. Start ENVI.

3. You should find a RTWTools menu has appeared on the main ENVI menubar.

**Note:** If you are upgrading from a previous installation of RTWTools you may find that you end up with two RTWTools menus on the ENVI menu bar. To solve this, open the envi.men file in ``C:\Program Files\ITT\IDL708\products\envi46\menu`` and delete all the lines below ``0 {RTWTools}``.


Support
Support for RTWTools is available from the author, to a limited extent. It should be remembered that the author is in the process of studying for a PhD, and therefore does not have unlimited time.
A RTWTools Google Group is available at http://groups.google.com/group/rtwtools, and all questions, bug reports and feature requests should be directed there.
